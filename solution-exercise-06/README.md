Exercise: Subsequent Sibling
You need to style all p elements that are siblings of h2 elements and come after them in the HTML so that their text appears italicized. Currently, all elements are styled using a universal selector (\*). Replace this with a subsequent-sibling combinator selector that targets only the p elements that are siblings of h2 elements and come after them.
